## Overview {#overview}
**emmeans** is a continuation of the **lsmeans** package. The name is
changed for two reasons:

  1. The term "least-squares means" is misleading in terms of describing 
     the analyses it provides. The term "estimated marginal means" (EMMs) is
     well-accepted, and it better describes the basic idea that we use
     marginal means of predictions over a reference grid. When we do that
     with, say, an ordinal model, the concept "estimated marginal mean"
     makes sense while "least-squares mean" does not, because no 
     least-squares methods are used to fit the model or obtain the EMMs.
  2. A number of changes are made to the internal architecture of the
     package. The **lsmeans** package had two classes, `ref.grid` and `lsmobj`,
     and it was confusing to some users that they needed to use primarily
     `ref.grid` methods to summarize `lsmobj` objects. The **emmeans**
     package has only an `emmGrid` class that covers both of the old classes.
     Changing the name of the package at the same time as the object 
     classes are changed makes for a cleaner transition.

## User impact {#impact}
For the most part, all that most users need to do to transition from
using the **lsmeans** package is to use `require(emmeans)` 
or `library(emmeans)` to load the package. With that one change,
almost all of the code in the *using-lsmeans* vignette runs without alteration,
and almost all examples from the help system for **lsmeans** also work as-is. 
Even though we
now emphasize using the `emmeans()` function and related "em" functions,
`lsmeans()` and its relatives are still available as wrappers for the new
functions.

That said, here are a few changes that former **lsmeans** users may
need to be aware of:

  * The package provides a utility `emmeans:::convert_scripts()` that may be
    used to convert old scripts that used **lsmeans** to use **emmeans** instead.
    [See more below](#scripts)
  * Some functions are deprecated, e.g. `ref.grid()`, `lsm.options()`, etc.
    They will work, but you will get a deprecated message advising you to
    use `ref_grid()` and `emm_options()`, etc.[^1]
    
    [^1]: Many of the deprecated functions, like `ref.grid()`, are renamed to
    avoid possible confusion in S3 method dispatch: how do we know that
    `summary.ref.grid()` wasn't a `summary.ref()` method for class `grid`,
    rather than a `summary()` method for class `ref.grid`?
    
  * While the functions `lsmeans()`, `lsmip()`, etc. will continue to be
    provided, all the help-page and vignette descriptions refer to their
    new counterparts `emmeans()`, `emmip()`, etc. So you will need to
    get accustomed to new terminology like "EMMs", even if you don't
    choose to use it in your own work.[^2]
    
    [^2]: By the way, the `pmmeans()`, `pmmip()`, etc. wrappers already
    provided in **lsmeans** are also still available.
    
  * If you have any scripts that include calls prefixed by `lsmeans::`,
    or calls to `require(lsmeans)` or `library(lsmeans)`, obviously you
    need to change these to use `emmeans` instead.
  * If you have any custom contrast functions, you need to rename them
    with an extension of `.emmc` instead of `lsmc`. See the example
    under `help("contrast-methods")`.
  * If you have saved results from previous runs in **lsmeans** (i.e.,
    `ref.grid` or `lsmobj` objects), they should still work in **emmeans**. The
    issue you may face, though, is that the **lsmeans** package could get loaded
    simply because these objects are present, and put in the `search()` path. To
    make sure you're using the new package, convert the objects to class `emmGrid`
    -- e.g., `my_new_ref_grid <- as.emmGrid(my.old.ref.grid)`.
    Running the non-exported function `emmeans:::convert_workspace()` may
    be used to convert all the objects in an environment (the global
    one by default) and clean out any dependencies on **lsmeans**. 
    [See more below](#workspaces)
  * The `emmip()` and `plot()` functions use graphics from the **ggplot2**
    package by default. If you prefer the **lattice** graphics produced
    by the **lsmeans** package, they are still available: Use 
    `emm_options(graphics.engine = "lattice")` to change the default,
    or add `engine = "lattice"` to the call to for a particular plot.
  * To get complete information about models supported by **emmeans**,
    use [`vignette("models")`](models.html) rather than the help page of the same name.
    It includes a quick reference chart at the beginning that should
    prove helpful.
  * The "using-lsmeans" vignette has been replaced by a number of
    smaller vignettes that cover specific topics. Start with 
    [`vignette("basics")`](basics.html) to obtain an overview.  The
    [vignette index](index.html) has links to all the vignettes.
  * The options `lsmeans` and `ref.grid` have been 
    remapped to `emmeans` and `ref_grid` respectively. For example, calling 
    `lsm.options(lsmeans = ...)` remaps as `emm_options(emmeans = ...)`. 
    See `help("emm_options", package = "emmeans")` and 
    `help("lsm.options", package = "lsmeans")` for explanations of these 
    options.
  * The degrees-of-freedom saga, continued... Initially, **lsmeans** used the
    **pbkrtest** package to compute degrees of freedom (via the Kenward-Roger 
    method) for `lme4::lmerMod` models. Later, the default was changed to the 
    Satterthwaite method, implemented in the **lmerTest** package. Both methods 
    are problematic; but I have decided to revert to the Kenward-Roger method 
    as the system default. The default may be changed via 
    `emm_options(lmer.df = ...)`. See [`vignette("models")`](models.html#L) for details.

## Converting scripts {#scripts}
<!-- @index `convert_scripts()`; **lsmeans** package!Converting scripts -->
The user may run 
```
emmeans:::convert_scripts()
```
to convert R scripts or R Markdown files to use **emmeans** functions. 
(This is a non-exported function -- you need three `:`s in there.)

  * You will get a file-open dialog
    where you can browse for the files -- multiple files may be selected. 
  * You will also be prompted for whether or not you want calls to `lsmeans()` 
    or `pmmeans()`to be replaced by calls to `emmeans()` (it's your choice; the
    former still work).
  * Each converted file is saved in the same directory with `-emm` added to the
    root name; for example, `myfile.R` is converted and saved as `myfile-emm.R`.

The conversion routines will convert the following to their `emmeans` counterparts:

  * `require(lsmeans)` and `library(lsmeans)` to `require(emmeans)` and `library(emmeans)`
  * `lsmeans::` to `emmeans::`
  * `ref.grid(` to `ref_grid(`
  * `lsm.options(` and `get.lsm.option(` to `emm_options(` and `get_emm_option(`
    (arguments thereof are also converted).
  * `.lsmc` to `.emmc` (contrast-method names)
  * `lsmeans(` and relatives to `emmeans(` and relatives, if opted for
  * `pmmeans(` and relatives to `emmeans(` and relatives, if opted for

## Converting workspaces {#workspaces}
<!-- @index `convert_workspace()`; **lsmeans** package!Converting workspaces -->
If you have any objects from the **lsmeans** package laying around, it is
all too likely that the **lsmeans** package will be loaded, and perhaps
even get added to the search path. This can create annoying messages, if not
conflicts. When this happens, type 
```
emmeans:::convert_workspace()
``` 
on the console. This will convert any `ref.grid` or `lsmobj` objects laying
around to the new `emmGrid` class, and unload all vestiges of **lsmeans**.

Once you are comfortable using **emmeans** in place of **lsmeans**, you
may effect a permanent solution (the "nuclear option?") by uninstalling
the **lsmeans** package. Doing so will *not* prevent you from converting old
workspaces or scripts. Watch your package updates carefully, though,
as it may get re-installed if it is still imported by another package.

## Notes for package developers to transition to emmeans support {#devel}
<!-- @index **lsmeans** package!Information for package developers -->
if you are the developer of a package that supports **lsmeans**, and you want to transition to supporting **emmeans**, I make the following suggestions:

 1. Currently, your package provides methods `recover.data.xyz()` and 
    `lsm.basis.xyz()`, where `xyz` stands in for the class of your object. Rename
    these functions `recover_data.xyz()` and `emm_basis.xyz()`.
 2. Any calls to `lsmeans::` functions in the above methods should be changed
    to the corresponding `emmeans::` functions.
 3. For a period of time, you may want to continue support for **lsmeans** 
    as well. So write new functions `recover.data.xyz()` and `lsm.basis.xyz()`
    that just call their counterparts.
 4. In your `DESCRIPTION` file, add `emmeans` to `Imports`, and make sure that
    `lsmeans` is *not* in `Imports`.
 5. In your `NAMESPACE` file,
     a. add `importFrom(emmeans, recover_data, emm_basis)`
     b. add `S3method(recover_data, xyz)`
     c. add `S3method(emm_basis, xyz)`
     d. add `export(recover.data.xyz, lsm.basis.xyz)`. 
        That is, export them as *functions*,
        and *not* as S3 methods
     e. In lieu of (a)-(c) above, you could just export the functions
        `recover_data.xyz` and `emm_basis.xyz`.
