## Pairwise comparisons {#pairwise}
<!-- @index Pairwise comparisons; Contrasts!Pairwise; `pairs()` -->
The most common follow-up analysis for models having factors as predictors is
to compare the EMMs with one another. This may be done simply via the `pairs()`
method for `emmGrid` objects. In the code below, we obtain the EMMs for `source` for
the `pigs` data, and then compare the sources pairwise.
```{r}
pigs.lm <- lm(log(conc) ~ source + factor(percent), data = pigs)
pigs.emm.s <- emmeans(pigs.lm, "source")
pairs(pigs.emm.s)
```
<!-- @index `adjust`; `summary()`!`adjust`; `summary()`!`infer` -->
In its out-of-the-box configuration, `pairs()` sets two defaults for 
[`summary()`](confidence-intervals.html#summary): `adjust = "tukey"`
(multiplicity adjustment), and `infer = c(FALSE, TRUE)` (test statistics, not
confidence intervals). You may override these, of course, by calling `summary()`
on the result with different values for these.

In the example above, EMMs for later factor levels are subtracted from those for
earlier levels; if you want the comparisons to go in the other direction, use
`pairs(pigs.emm.s, reverse = TRUE)`. Also, in multi-factor situations,
you may specify `by` factor(s) to perform the comparisons separately at the 
levels of those factors.

<!-- @index Comparisons!Graphical -->
Comparisons may be summarized graphically via the `comparisons` argument
in `plot.emm()`:
```{r fig.height = 1.5}
plot(pigs.emm.s, comparisons = TRUE)
```

The blue bars are confidence intervals for the EMMs, and the red arrows are for 
the comparisons among them. If an arrow from one mean overlaps an arrow from
another group, the difference is not significant, based on the `adjust` setting
(which defaults to `"tukey"`). (Note: Don't ever use confidence intervals for
EMMs to perform comparisons; they can be very misleading.)

<!-- @index `CLD()`; `CLD()`!versus `multcomp::cld()`; Comparisons!Displaying as groups -->
Another way to depict comparisons is by compact-letter displays:
```{r}
CLD(pigs.emm.s)
```
Two EMMs sharing one or more grouping symbols are not significantly different.
I really don't recommend this method, though, as it imposes a stark difference
between *P* values slightly less and slightly more than `alpha`.

*Note:* The **multcomp** package provides a very similar function named `cld()`. A
corresponding method is provided for `emmGrid` objects; thus, if `package:multcomp`
is attached, you may call `cld()` and obtain the same results as with `CLD()`.

## Other contrasts {#contrasts}
<!-- @index `contrast()`; `coef()`; Contrasts!Polynomial -->
Pairwise comparisons are an example of linear functions of EMMs.
You may use `coef()` to see the coefficients of these linear functions:
```{r}
coef(pairs(pigs.emm.s))
```
The pairwise comparisons correspond to columns of the above results.
For example, the first pairwise comparison, `fish - soy`, gives coefficients
of 1, -1, and 0 to fish, soy, and skim, respectively. In cases, such as this
one, where each column of coefficients sums to zero, the linear functions
are termed *contrasts*

The `contrast()` function provides for general contrasts (and linear functions,
as well) of factor levels. Its second argument, `method`, is used to specify
what method is to be used. In this section we describe the built-in ones,
where we simply provide the name of the built-in method. Consider, for example,
the factor `percent` in the model `pigs.lm` . It is treated as a factor in 
the model, but it corresponds to equally-spaced values of a numeric variable.
In such cases, users often want to compute orthogonal polynomial contrasts:
```{r}
pigs.emm.p <- emmeans(pigs.lm, "percent")
ply <- contrast(pigs.emm.p, "poly")
ply

coef(ply)
```
We obtain tests for the linear, quadratic, and cubic trends. The coefficients
are those that can be found in tables in many experimental-design texts.
It is important to understand that the estimated linear contrast is *not* the
slope of a line fitted to the data. It is simply a contrast having coefficients
that increase linearly. It *does* test the linear trend, however.

<!-- @index Dunnett method; `pairwise` contrasts; `revpairwise` contrasts; `trt.vs.ctrl` contrasts;
            `eff` contrasts; `consec` contrasts -->
There are a number of other named contrast methods, for example `"trt.vs.ctrl"`,
`"eff"`, and `"consec"`. The `"pairwise"` and `"revpairwise"` methods in `contrast()` are the same as `Pairs()` and `pairs(..., reverse = TRUE)`. See
[help("contrast-methods")](../html/emmc-functions.html) for details.

## Formula interface {#formulas}
<!-- @index `specs`!Formula; Contrasts!Formula; `emm_list` object
             Examples!`oranges` -->
If you already know what contrasts you will want before calling `emmeans()`, 
a quick way to get them is to specify the method as the left-hand side of the formula in its second argument. For example, with the `oranges` dataset
provided in the package,
```{r}
org.aov <- aov(sales1 ~ day + Error(store), data = oranges,
               contrasts = list(day = "contr.sum"))
org.emml <- emmeans(org.aov, consec ~ day)
org.emml
```
The contrasts shown are the day-to-day changes.

This two-sided formula technique is quite convenient, but it can also create
confusion. For one thing, the result is not an `emmGrid` object anymore; it is a
`list` of `emmGrid` objects, called an `emm_list`. You may need to be cognizant of
that if you are to do further contrasts or other analyzes. For example if you
want `"eff"` contrasts as well, you need to do `contrast(org.emml[[1]],
"eff")` or `contrast(org.emml, "eff", which = 1)`.

Another issue is that it may be unclear which part of the results is
affected by certain options. For example, if you were to add `adjust = "bonf"`
to the `org.emm` call above, would the Bonferroni adjustment be applied to the
EMMs, or to the contrasts? (See the documentation if interested; but the best practice is to avoid such dilemmas.)

## Custom contrasts and linear functions {#linfcns}
<!-- @index Contrasts!Custom; `.emmc` functions@emmc; `contrast()`!`adjust` -->
The user may write a custom contrast function for use in `contrast()`.
What's needed is a function having the desired name with `".emmc"` appended,
that generates the needed coefficients as a list or data frame. The
function should take a vector of levels as its first argument, 
and any optional parameters as additional arguments. For example,
suppose we want to compare every third level of a treatment. 
The following function provides for this:
```{r}
skip_comp.emmc <- function(levels, skip = 1, reverse = FALSE) {
    if((k <- length(levels)) < skip + 1)
        stop("Need at least ", skip + 1, " levels")
    coef <- data.frame()
    coef <- as.data.frame(lapply(seq_len(k - skip - 1), function(i) {
        sgn <- ifelse(reverse, -1, 1)
        sgn * c(rep(0, i - 1), 1, rep(0, skip), -1, rep(0, k - i - skip - 1))
    }))
    names(coef) <- sapply(coef, function(x)
        paste(which(x == 1), "-", which(x == -1)))
    attr(coef, "adjust") = "fdr"   # default adjustment method
    coef
}
```
To test it, try 5 levels:
```{r}
skip_comp.emmc(1:5)

skip_comp.emmc(1:5, skip = 0, reverse = TRUE)
```
(The latter is the same as `"consec"` contrasts.)
Now try it with the `oranges` example we had previously:
```{r}
contrast(org.emml[[1]], "skip_comp", skip = 2, reverse = TRUE)
```

####### {#linfct}
<!-- @index Linear functions; `contrast()`!Linear functions -->
The `contrast()` function may in fact be used to compute arbitrary linear
functions of EMMs. Suppose for some reason we want to estimate the quantities
$\lambda_1 = \mu_1+2\mu_2-7$ and $\lambda_2 = 3\mu_2-2\mu_3+1$, where the
$\mu_j$ are the population values of the `source` EMMs in the `pigs` example. 
This may be done by providing the coefficients in a list, and the added
constants in the `offset` argument:
```{r}
LF <- contrast(pigs.emm.s, 
               list(lambda1 = c(1, 2, 0), lambda2 = c(0, 3, -2)),
               offset = c(-7, 1))
confint(LF, adjust = "bonferroni")
```

## Special properties of log (and logit) transformations {#logs}
<!-- @index Transformations!Log; Comparisons!with logs@logs;
            Comparisons!Back-transforming -->
Suppose we obtain EMMs for a model having a response transformation 
or link function. In most cases, when we compute contrasts of those EMMs,
there is no natural way to express those contrasts on anything other
than the transformed scale. For example, in a model fitted using `glm()`
with the `gamma()` family, the default link function is the inverse.
Predictions on such a model are estimates of $1/\mu_j$ for various $j$.
Comparisons of predictions will be estimates of $1/\mu_j - 1/\mu_{k}$
for $j \ne k$. There is no natural way to back-transform these 
differences to some other interpretable scale.

However, logs are an exception, in that 
$\log\mu_j - \log\mu_k = \log(\mu_j/\mu_k)$. Accordingly, when `contrast()`
(or `pairs()`) notices that the response is on the log scale, it back-transforms 
contrasts to ratios when results are to be of `response` type. For example:
```{r}
pairs(pigs.emm.s, type = "lp")

pairs(pigs.emm.s, type = "response")
```
<!-- @index Contrasts!Tests of!with transformations@trans -->
As is true of EMM summaries with `type = "response"`, the tests and confidence
intervals are done before back-transforming. The ratios estimated here are
actually ratios of *geometric* means. In general, a model with a log response is
in fact a model for *relative* effects of any of its linear predictors, and this
back-transformation to ratios goes hand-in-hand with that.

In generalized linear models, this behaviors will occur in two common cases:
Poisson or count regression, for which the usual link is the log; and logistic
regression, because logits are logs of odds ratios.
