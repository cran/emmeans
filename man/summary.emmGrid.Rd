}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"emmGrid"} (see \link{emmGrid-class})}

\item{infer}{A vector of one or two logical values. The first determines
whether confidence intervals are displayed, and the second determines
whether \emph{t} tests and \emph{P} values are displayed. If only one value
is provided, it is used for both.}

\item{level}{Numerical value between 0 and 1. Confidence level for confidence
intervals, if \code{infer[1]} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{adjust}{Character value naming the method used to adjust \eqn{p} values
or confidence limits; or to adjust comparison arrows in \code{plot}. See
the P-value adjustments section below.}

\item{by}{Character name(s) of variables to use for grouping into separate 
tables. This affects the family of tests considered in adjusted \emph{P}
values.}

\item{type}{Character: type of prediction desired. This only has an effect if
there is a known transformation or link function. \code{"response"} 
specifies that the inverse transformation be applied. \code{"mu"} (or 
equivalently, \code{"unlink"}) is usually the same as \code{"response"},
but in the case where the model has both a link function and a response 
transformation, only the link part is back-transformed. Other valid values 
are \code{"link"}, \code{"lp"}, and \code{"linear.predictor"}; these are
equivalent, and request that results be shown for the linear predictor,
with no back-transformation. The default is \code{"link"}, unless the 
\code{"predict.type"} option is in force; see \code{\link{emm_options}},
and also the section below on transformations and links.}

\item{df}{Numeric. If non-missing, a constant number of degrees of freedom to
use in constructing confidence intervals and \emph{P} values (\code{NA}
specifies asymptotic results).}

\item{calc}{Named list of character value(s) or formula(s).
The expressions in \code{char} are evaluated and appended to the
summary, just after the \code{df} column. The expression may include
any names up through \code{df} in the summary, any additional names in 
\code{object@grid} (such as \code{.wgt.} or \code{.offset.}), or any
earlier elements of \code{calc}.}

\item{null}{Numeric. Null hypothesis value(s), on the linear-predictor scale,
against which estimates are tested. May be a single value used for all, or
a numeric vector of length equal to the number of tests in each family
(i.e., \code{by} group in the displayed table).}

\item{delta}{Numeric value (on the linear-predictor scale). If zero, ordinary
tests of significance are performed. If positive, this specifies a
threshold for testing equivalence (using the TOST or two-one-sided-test
method), non-inferiority, or non-superiority, depending on \code{side}. See
Details for how the test statistics are defined.}

\item{side}{Numeric or character value specifying whether the test is
left-tailed (\code{-1}, \code{"-"}, code{"<"}, \code{"left"}, or
\code{"nonsuperiority"}); right-tailed (\code{1}, \code{"+"}, \code{">"},
\code{"right"}, or \code{"noninferiority"}); or two-sided (\code{0},
\code{2}, \code{"!="}, \code{"two-sided"}, \code{"both"},
\code{"equivalence"}, or \code{"="}). See the special section below for
more details.}

\item{frequentist}{Ignored except if a Bayesian model was fitted. If missing
or \code{FALSE}, the object is passed to \code{\link{hpd.summary}}. Otherwise, 
a logical value of \code{TRUE} will have it return a frequentist summary.}

\item{bias.adjust}{Logical value for whether to adjust for bias in
back-transforming (\code{type = "response"}). This requires a value of 
\code{sigma} to exist in the object or be specified.}

\item{sigma}{Error SD assumed for bias correction (when 
\code{type = "response"} and a transformation
is in effect), or for constructing prediction intervals. If not specified,
\code{object@misc$sigma} is used, and an error is thrown if it is not found.
\emph{Note:} \code{sigma} may be a vector, as long as it conforms to the number of rows
of the reference grid.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments such as \code{scheffe.rank} 
(see \dQuote{P-value adjustments}). 
In \code{as.data.frame.emmGrid}, \code{confint.emmGrid}, 
\code{predict.emmGrid}, and 
\code{test.emmGrid}, these arguments are passed to
\code{summary.emmGrid}.}

\item{interval}{Type of interval desired (partial matching is allowed): 
\code{"none"} for no intervals,
  otherwise confidence or prediction intervals with given arguments, 
  via \code{\link{confint.emmGrid}}.}

\item{x}{object of the given class}

\item{row.names}{passed to \code{\link{as.data.frame}}}

\item{optional}{passed to \code{\link{as.data.frame}}}

\item{as.df}{Logical value. With \code{x[..., as.df = TRUE]}, the result is
object is coerced to an ordinary \code{\link{data.frame}}; otherwise, it is left as a 
\code{summary_emm} object.}

\item{parm}{(Required argument for \code{confint} methods, but not used)}

\item{joint}{Logical value. If \code{FALSE}, the arguments are passed to 
\code{\link{summary.emmGrid}} with \code{infer=c(FALSE, TRUE)}. If \code{joint = 
TRUE}, a joint test of the hypothesis L beta = null is performed, where L 
is \code{object@linfct} and beta is the vector of fixed effects estimated 
by \code{object@betahat}. This will be either an \emph{F} test or a 
chi-square (Wald) test depending on whether degrees of freedom are 
available. See also \code{\link{joint_tests}}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE} and \code{joint = TRUE}, a table
of the effects being tested is printed.}

\item{rows}{Integer values. The rows of L to be tested in the joint test. If
missing, all rows of L are used. If not missing, \code{by} variables are
ignored.}

\item{status}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, a \code{note} column showing status
flags (for rank deficiencies and estimability issues) is displayed even 
when empty. If \code{FALSE}, the column is included only if there are 
such issues.}
}
\value{
\code{summary.emmGrid}, \code{confint.emmGrid}, and
  \code{test.emmGrid} return an object of class \code{"summary_emm"}, which
  is an extension of \code{\link{data.frame}} but with a special \code{print}
  method that displays it with custom formatting. For models fitted using
  MCMC methods, the call is diverted to \code{\link{hpd.summary}} (with 
  \code{prob} set to \code{level}, if specified); one may
  alternatively use general MCMC summarization tools with the 
  results of \code{as.mcmc}.

\code{predict} returns a vector of predictions for each row of \code{object@grid}.

The \code{as.data.frame} method returns a plain data frame,
  equivalent to \code{as.data.frame(summary(.))}.
}
\description{
These are the primary methods for obtaining numerical or tabular results 
from an \code{emmGrid} object. 
\code{summary.emmGrid} is the general function for summarizing \code{emmGrid} objects. 
It also serves as the print method for these objects; so for convenience,
\code{summary()} arguments may be included in calls to functions such as 
\code{\link{emmeans}} and \code{\link{contrast}} that construct \code{emmGrid} 
objects. Note that by default, summaries for Bayesian models are
diverted to \code{\link{hpd.summary}}.
}
\details{
\code{confint.emmGrid} is equivalent to \code{summary.emmGrid with 
infer = c(TRUE, FALSE)}. When called with \code{joint = FALSE}, \code{test.emmGrid}
is equivalent to \code{summary.emmGrid} with \code{infer = c(FALSE, TRUE)}. 

With \code{joint = TRUE}, \code{test.emmGrid} calculates the Wald test of the
hypothesis \code{linfct \%*\% bhat = null}, where \code{linfct} and
\code{bhat} refer to slots in \code{object} (possibly subsetted according to
\code{by} or \code{rows}). An error is thrown if any row of \code{linfct} is
non-estimable. It is permissible for the rows of \code{linfct} to be linearly
dependent, as long as \code{null == 0}, in which case a reduced set of 
contrasts is tested. Linear dependence and nonzero \code{null} cause an 
error.
}
\note{
In doing testing and a transformation and/or link is in force, any
  \code{null} and/or \code{delta} values specified must always be on the
  scale of the linear predictor, regardless of the setting for `type`. If
  \code{type = "response"}, the null value displayed in the summary table 
  will be back-transformed from the value supplied by the user. But the
  displayed \code{delta} will not be changed, because there (usually) is
  not a natural way to back-transform it.

The default \code{show} method for \code{emmGrid} objects (with the
  exception of newly created reference grids) is \code{print(summary())}.
  Thus, with ordinary usage of \code{\link{emmeans}} and such, it is
  unnecessary to call \code{summary} unless there is a need to
  specify other than its default options.
}
\section{Defaults}{

  The \code{misc} slot in \code{object} may contain default values for
  \code{by}, \code{calc}, \code{infer}, \code{level}, \code{adjust}, 
  \code{type}, \code{null}, \code{side}, and \code{delta}. 
  These defaults vary depending
  on the code that created the object. The \code{\link{update}} method may be
  used to change these defaults. In addition, any options set using 
  \samp{emm_options(summary = ...)} will trump those stored in the object's 
  \code{misc} slot.
}

\section{Transformations and links}{

  With \code{type = "response"}, the transformation assumed can be found in
  \samp{object@misc$tran}, and its label, for the summary is in
  \samp{object@misc$inv.lbl}. Any \eqn{t} or \eqn{z} tests are still performed
  on the scale of the linear predictor, not the inverse-transformed one.
  Similarly, confidence intervals are computed on the linear-predictor scale,
  then inverse-transformed.
  
  When \code{bias.adjust} is \code{TRUE}, then back-transformed estimates
  are adjusted by adding 
  \eqn{0.5 h''(u)\sigma^2}, where \eqn{h} is the inverse transformation and
  \eqn{u} is the linear predictor. This is based on a second-order Taylor
  expansion. There are better or exact adjustments for certain specific
  cases, and these may be incorporated in future updates.
}

\section{P-value adjustments}{

  The \code{adjust} argument specifies a multiplicity adjustment for tests or
  confidence intervals. This adjustment always is applied \emph{separately}
  to each table or sub-table that you see in the printed output (see
  \code{\link{rbind.emmGrid}} for how to combine tables). 
  
  The valid values of \code{adjust} are as follows:
  \describe{
  \item{\code{"tukey"}}{Uses the Studentized range distribution with the number
    of means in the family. (Available for two-sided cases only.)}
  \item{\code{"scheffe"}}{Computes \eqn{p} values from the \eqn{F}
    distribution, according to the Scheffe critical value of
    \eqn{\sqrt{rF(\alpha; r, d)}}{sqrt[r*qf(alpha, r, d)]}, where \eqn{d} is
    the error degrees of freedom and \eqn{r} is the rank of the set of linear
    functions under consideration. By default, the value of \code{r} is
    computed from \code{object@linfct} for each by group; however, if the
    user specifies an argument matching \code{scheffe.rank}, its value will
    be used instead. Ordinarily, if there are \eqn{k} means involved, then
    \eqn{r = k - 1} for a full set of contrasts involving all \eqn{k} means, and
    \eqn{r = k} for the means themselves. (The Scheffe adjustment is available
    for two-sided cases only.)}
  \item{\code{"sidak"}}{Makes adjustments as if the estimates were independent
    (a conservative adjustment in many cases).}
  \item{\code{"bonferroni"}}{Multiplies \eqn{p} values, or divides significance
    levels by the number of estimates. This is a conservative adjustment.}
  \item{\code{"dunnettx"}}{Uses our own\emph{ad hoc} approximation to the 
    Dunnett distribution for a family of estimates having pairwise
    correlations of \eqn{0.5} (as is true when comparing treatments with a
    control with equal sample sizes). The accuracy of the approximation
    improves with the number of simultaneous estimates, and is much faster
    than \code{"mvt"}. (Available for two-sided cases only.)}
  \item{\code{"mvt"}}{Uses the multivariate \eqn{t} distribution to assess the
    probability or critical value for the maximum of \eqn{k} estimates. This
    method produces the same \eqn{p} values and intervals as the default
    \code{summary} or \code{confint} methods to the results of
    \code{\link{as.glht}}. In the context of pairwise comparisons or comparisons
    with a control, this produces \dQuote{exact} Tukey or Dunnett adjustments,
    respectively. However, the algorithm (from the \pkg{mvtnorm} package) uses a
    Monte Carlo method, so results are not exactly repeatable unless the same
    random-number seed is used (see \code{\link[base:Random]{set.seed}}). As the family
    size increases, the required computation time will become noticeable or even
    intolerable, making the \code{"tukey"}, \code{"dunnettx"}, or others more
    attractive.}
  \item{\code{"none"}}{Makes no adjustments to the \eqn{p} values.}
  } %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end \describe {}

  For tests, not confidence intervals, the Bonferroni-inequality-based adjustment
  methods in \code{\link{p.adjust}} are also available (currently, these
  include \code{"holm"}, \code{"hochberg"}, \code{"hommel"},
  \code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"}, \code{"fdr"}, and
  \code{"none"}). If a \code{p.adjust.methods} method other than
  \code{"bonferroni"} or \code{"none"} is specified for confidence limits, the
  straight Bonferroni adjustment is used instead. Also, if an adjustment method
  is not appropriate (e.g., using \code{"tukey"} with one-sided tests, or with
  results that are not pairwise comparisons), a more appropriate method
  (usually \code{"sidak"}) is substituted.

  In some cases, confidence and \eqn{p}-value adjustments are only approximate
  -- especially when the degrees of freedom or standard errors vary greatly
  within the family of tests. The \code{"mvt"} method is always the correct
  one-step adjustment, but it can be very slow. One may use
  \code{\link{as.glht}} with methods in the \pkg{multcomp} package to obtain
  non-conservative multi-step adjustments to tests.
}

\section{Testing nonsuperiority, noninferiority, or equivalence}{

  When \code{delta = 0}, test statistics are of the usual form 
  \samp{(estimate - null)/SE}, or notationally, \eqn{t = (Q - \theta_0)/SE} 
  where \eqn{Q} is our estimate of \eqn{\theta}; 
  then left, right, or two-sided \eqn{p} values are produced.

  When \code{delta} is positive, the test statistic depends on \code{side} as
  follows.
  \describe{
  \item{Left-sided (nonsuperiority)}{\eqn{H_0: \theta \ge \theta_0 + \delta}
    versus \eqn{H_1: \theta < \theta_0 + \delta}\cr 
    \eqn{t = (Q - \theta_0 - \delta)/SE}\cr 
    The \eqn{p} value is the lower-tail probability.}
  \item{Right-sided (noninferiority)}{\eqn{H_0: \theta \le \theta_0 - \delta}
    versus \eqn{H_1: \theta > \theta_0 - \delta}\cr 
    \eqn{t = (Q - \theta_0 + \delta)/SE}\cr
    The \eqn{p} value is the upper-tail probability.}
  \item{Two-sided (equivalence)}{\eqn{H_0: |\theta - \theta_0| \ge \delta}
    versus \eqn{H_1: |\theta - \theta_0| < \delta}\cr
    \eqn{t = (|Q - \theta_0| - \delta)/SE}\cr
    The \eqn{p} value is the \emph{lower}-tail probability.}
  } %%%%%%%%%%%% end \describe{}
}

\section{Non-estimable cases}{

  When the model is rank-deficient, each row \code{x} of \code{object}'s
  \code{linfct} slot is checked for estimability. If \code{sum(x*bhat)}
  is found to be non-estimable, then the string \code{NonEst} is displayed for the
  estimate, and associated statistics are set to \code{NA}. 
  The estimability check is performed
  using the orthonormal basis \code{N} in the \code{nbasis} slot for the null
  space of the rows of the model matrix. Estimability fails when
  \eqn{||Nx||^2 / ||x||^2} exceeds \code{tol}, which by default is
  \code{1e-8}. You may change it via \code{\link{emm_options}} by setting
  \code{estble.tol} to the desired value.
}

\section{Warning about potential misuse of P values}{

  A growing consensus in the statistical and scientific community is that
  the term \dQuote{statistical significance} should be completely abandoned, and
  that criteria such as \dQuote{p < 0.05} never be used to assess the
  importance of an effect. These practices are just too misleading and prone to abuse.
  See \href{../doc/basics.html#pvalues}{the \dQuote{basics} vignette} for more
  discussion.
