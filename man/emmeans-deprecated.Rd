\usage{
ref.grid(...)

recover.data(object, ...)

lsm.basis(object, ...)

\arguments{
\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods}

\item{object}{An \code{emmGrid} object}
}
\description{
Over time, some functions and internal structures have been revised or
expanded, and as a consequence this necessitates renaming or
reconceptualization of the functions it exports. This is a quick reference on
how to get what you want if what worked in the past no longer does.

\describe{
\FCN{as.stanfit}{We suggest using \code{as.mcmc()} instead, and plotting
the results using functions in \pkg{bayesplot}.}
.
\CLS{lsmobj}{Both this  and the \cls{ref.grid} have been replaced by the
\cls{emmGrid}.}

\FCN{ref.grid}{This has been replaced by \code{ref_grid()}, in hopes of
reducing the chance that \code{ref.grid} will be mistaken as an S3 method for
class \code{grid}.}

\CLS{ref.grid}{Both this  and the \cls{lsmobj} have been replaced by the
\cls{emmGrid}.}

\ARG{trend}{The \code{trend} argument in \code{lsmeans} (now \code{emmeans})
is now deprecated. Use \code{emtrends()} instead.}
